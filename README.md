<h1> European-School-Competition-EU-Quiz-</h1>
<h4>This is my first app, made with flutter and dart. It's a quiz about the EU with 100 questions. It was made from 0 to 100% in just 4 days. I can't even believe, that 4 days ago I didn't knew even how to print a "hello world" in dart, and now, 4 days later I created my first app. I learned flutter from YouTube videos and if you're a beginner I 100% suggest the videos of a YouTube channel called "The Net Ninja". Anyways, my code is not very well structured (I could use more classes, functions, files etc.) to modularize my app but I just wanted to create an app from 0 to 100% as fast as possible. I am having some problems with publishing my app to play store and app store, but I will solve them, and my apps will be published within next days. I also want to improve the quiz in the next days. I want to add a categories option, in order for the users to be able to choose if they want questions only from a certain category. I also want to add a 10 seconds timer for each question. Furthermore, I want to add another 400 questions and finally, I want to add difficulty levels (Easy, Medium and Hard).  That's a cool way to spend my quarantine as a 16 years old boy, haha.</h4>
